Redo your DVDs program of the preceding assignment with the constructor's first argument's type being  const string &  instead of the type specified for the argument in the preceding assignment (const string), and with the method get_title() (or whatever you're calling your accessor get-method for title) having the return-type  const string & .  Then, make all the rest of your code consistent with these new features.
Demonstrate compiling this new version and executing it (as specified in the preceding assignment for the basic, correct version of the program).
Print your program separately from your demonstration of it.  Please don't do something like using cat to include your code with the demonstration.

Collate your work for this exercise in the following order:

    demo
    dvd.h
    dvd.cpp
    main module 


Here is linked-list code from CIS 163.  Convert it to C++. 
Instead of IntegerLinkedList.toString(), have an operator<<(). 

Collate your work for this exercise in the following order:

    demo
